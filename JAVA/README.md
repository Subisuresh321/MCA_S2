ROMAN INDEXED PROGRAMS

**I.** Define a class `Product` with data members `productCode`, `productName`, and `price`. Create three objects of the `Product` class and find the product with the lowest price.  

**II.** Write a menu-driven program to perform matrix operations (**addition, multiplication, transpose**).  

**III.** Perform the **addition of two complex numbers** using a class.  

**IV.** Check whether a **matrix is symmetric** or not.  

**V.** Create an array and **search for a particular item** in the array.  

**VI.** Perform **string manipulation**:  
   - Convert to **lowercase**  
   - Convert to **uppercase**  
   - Find the **length**  
   - Find the **substring**  
   - Find the **index of the first occurrence** of a character in a given string  

**VII.** Java program with a class for an **employee** having attributes `employeeNumber`, `employeeName`, `employeeSalary`.  
   - Find the **total salary** of the employee  
   - Calculate the **next salary** of the employee  

**VIII.** Write a **Java program to sort strings** using `compareTo()` method.  

**IX.** Program to **calculate the area of different shapes** using **overloaded functions**.  

**X.** Define a class **Employee** with members `employeeID`, `name`, `salary`, and `address`.  
   - Create a **constructor** to initialize the data members  
   - Create another class **Teacher**, which **inherits** the properties of `Employee`  
   - Add its own data members: `departments`, `subjectsTaught`, and `teacherName`  
   - Define **constructors** to initialize these data members  
   - Include a **display()** method to display all the data members  
   - Use an **array of objects** to display details of `N` teachers  

**XI.** Create an **interface** having prototypes of functions **`area`** and **`perimeter`**.  
   - Create two classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that **implement** this interface  
   - Create a **menu-driven program** to find the **area** and **perimeter** of objects  

Would you like me to provide Java code examples for any of these tasks? Let me know which one you'd like to dive into! ðŸš€
